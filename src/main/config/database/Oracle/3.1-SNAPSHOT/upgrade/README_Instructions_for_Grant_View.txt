In 3.1 the database user requires another permission to allow him to create “views”. To add this permission to the user run the Grant_View.sql script and give it the database username configured for your OpenClinica instance. This script must be ran before tomcat is started. This script should only be ran on databases that where established pre 3.1. If you run this script on a post 3.1 database no harm will come to your installation.
