# T006: event definitions
**Abstract:**  
This documents contains the definitions for tests that concern the management of event definitions. It doesn't apply to scheduling study-events for subjects. The actual consequences of the various settings of the properties of events are tested elsewhere. For example setting the property **double-data-entry** for a CRF in an event is only tested for setting it on and off, and not for the actual working of double-data-entry.
