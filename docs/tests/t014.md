# T014 data entry
**Abstract:**  
This documents contains the definitions for tests that target the feature 'data entry'.  
Two different types of data entry can occur, initial data entry and administrative editing, i.e. entering or changing data after the crf has been marked complete.
All tests that concern double-data-entry are described in [T015 - double data entry](tests/t015.md).

To test data entry a crf must be used that contains all possible combinations of response-types and data-types twice: one instance in a non-repeating item-group and one instance in a repeating item-group:  

| item response-type | data-type | item-group |  
|-|-|-|
| text | ST | non-repeating 
| text | INT | non-repeating |
| text | REAL | non-repeating |
| text | DATE | non-repeating |
| text | PDATE | non-repeating |
| single-select | INT | non-repeating |
| radio | INT | non-repeating |
| checkbox | ST | non-repeating |
| multi-select | ST | non-repeating |
| textarea | ST | non-repeating |
| file | FILE | non-repeating |
| text | ST | repeating 
| text | INT | repeating |
| text | REAL | repeating |
| text | DATE | repeating |
| text | PDATE | repeating |
| single-select | INT | repeating |
| radio | INT | repeating |
| checkbox | ST | repeating |
| multi-select | ST | repeating |
| textarea | ST | repeating |
| file | FILE | repeating |

This crf must be assigned to at least one event and in the properties of the event-crf-definition you must have defined at least two null-values.

## T014-01: initial data entry
**description:**  
This test focuses on the initial data entry, that is data entry when the crf has not yet been marked complete.

**prerequisite:**  
You must be logged in to a study that has subjects and at least one event with the crf described above assigned to it.

**workflow:**  
1. click in the main menu on **Subject Matrix**
1. click **Add New Subject** and enter the required items; select **View/Enter Data** for the event that has the test-crf assigned to it or, if necessary, schedule the event
1. in the form **Enter or Validate Data for CRFs in XXX** click on the pencil-icon, **Enter Data**, of the row of the test-crf
1. enter or select for each item a unique value; enter at least two rows of the repeating item-group; for each combination, except text, textarea and file, you should also enter a null-value
1. click **Save** until you've reached the last tab
1. click **Save** to close the form
1. verify that you're now in form **Enter or Validate Data for CRFs in XXX** again and that the status of the crf is **Initial Data Entry**

**expected results:**  
The message **Your data has been saved. You can continue entering/editing data now or return at a later time.** appears.  
Verify that the data have been stored correctly by clicking on the magnifier-icon, **View**, to the right of the crf and comparing the values.

## T014-02: mark crf complete
**description:**  
This test focuses on marking a crf complete.

**prerequisite:**  
You must successfully have completed **T014-01: initial data entry**

**workflow:**  
1. click in the main menu on **Subject Matrix**
1. click on the event used in **T014-01: initial data entry** and select **View/Enter Data**
1. select the crf used in **T014-01: initial data entry**
1. goto the last tab and check **Mark CRF Complete**
1. confirm the action by clicking **OK**
1. click **Save** to close the form
1. verify that you're now in form **Enter or Validate Data for CRFs in XXX** again and that the status of the crf is **Data Entry Complete**

**expected results:**  
The message **Your data has been saved and the CRF was marked complete.** appears.  

## T014-03: administrative editing
**description:**  
This test focuses on administrative editing, that is data entry after the crf has been marked complete.

**prerequisite:**  
You must successfully have completed **T014-01: initial data entry** and **T014-02: mark crf complete**

**workflow:**  
1. click in the main menu on **Subject Matrix**
1. click on the event used in **T012-04: mark crf complete** and select **View/Enter Data**
1. select the crf used in **T012-04: mark crf complete**
1. change every item; create for each item a **Reason for Change** discrepancy note
1. click **Save** to submit the changes
1. after the last tab, verify that you're now in form **Enter or Validate Data for CRFs in XXX** again

**expected results:**  
The message **Your data has been saved. You can continue entering/editing data now or return at a later time.** appears.  
Verify that the changes have been stored correctly by clicking on the magnifier-icon, **View**, to the right of the crf and comparing the values.
