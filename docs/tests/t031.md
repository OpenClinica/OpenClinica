# T031: study audit log
**Abstract:**  
This documents contains the definitions for tests that concern the study audit log. In the audit log all changes are recorded in a human readable form.  
The study audit log is available for both data-managers, study-directors and monitors. However for testing only the first two are considered, as a lot of changes are needed for the tests and the role of monitor can't make these changes.
This applies to the study subject, the events, the crf's and the items.  
The output is on a per-subject-basis.  
Actions for study build are not recorded in the study audit log.
