Installation Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------
OpenClinica runs and depends on several external applications: Sun's Java Development Kit, Apache Jakarta's Tomcat Servlet Container, and the Postgres Relational Database. (NOTE: Building the PostgreSQL server from source as described in this document, requires gcc and its dependent libraries to be installed).

<as user>Means to run the following commands using a normal unprivileged account (not root)
<as root>Means to run the following commands using the superuser account
<as tomcat>Means to run the following commands using the tomcat user
<as postgres>Means to run the following commands using the postgres user
NOTE: You probably will not know the tomcat or postgres passwords unless you explicitly set them. To login as one of these users without the password, you can login as root and then su - tomcat or su - postgres (note the dash between the su command and the user name, if you don't include that dash you will get a 'could not change directory to *username* error)

NOTE: The software stack OpenClinica runs on is open source, and most open source projects release minor versions and revisions often. Sometimes only a matter of weeks may separate the release of two adjacent versions of the software. For this release, the latest stable version of each component was used in integrated testing, and its revision number is referenced in this document. In some cases, the revision number mentioned may no longer be available. For the most part, you should be able to use later minor versions and revisions of the same software without incident. For instance, if the install guide uses PostgreSQL 8.3.6, PostgreSQL 8.2.1 should work as well. We recommend that you record the revision number you use. If you have concerns about a particular combination, please post your question to the users@openclinica.org mailing list.

NOTE: This installation guide is intended to get OpenClinica up and running as easily as possible on a Linux server. It does not go into details for development of OpenClinica from the source code. This information will be available soon, and will cover setting up Apache Ant and Eclipse.

*) Install Java 2 SDK 1.6 Update 16
*) Install Tomcat 6.0.20
*) Install PostgreSQL 8.4.1
*) Install OpenClinica 3.1-beta3
*) Configure OpenClinica 3.1-beta3

Install Java 2 SDK 1.6 Update 16
--------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Java might not be required since many systems already have a Java SDK installed. If you are unsure, or the system only has the Java run-time environment (JRE), please install this JDK. Your previous installation will still be available.

If you want to download the SDK from the website please go to:
https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u16-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer 
Select Linux as a Platform, and check the box next to I agree to the Java Development Kit 6.0 License Agreement and click on Continue
Then click on the  jdk-6u16-linux-i586.bin (not the RPM.BIN) link to start the download and save it to your disk.

After you download it run the following commands <as user>:
open a terminal
cd TO SAVE LOCATION OF DOWNLOADED FILE
sh jdk-6u16-linux-i586.bin
Read the license by pressing the spacebar until you get to bottom of screen, it will then rquire you to type "yes" and hit enter to extract
<as root >
mv  jdk1.6.0_16 /usr/local/ 
cd /usr/local/
ln -s jdk1.6.0_16 java
echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java" >> /etc/profile


Install OpenClinica 3.1-beta3 Package
----------------------------------------------------
Create a user account and download OpenClinica 3.1-beta3 from 
https://www.openclinica.com

<as user>
cd TO SAVE LOCATION OF DOWNLOADED FILE
tar -xzvf OpenClinica-3.1-beta3.zip
<as root>
mkdir /usr/local/oc
mv OpenClinica-3.1-beta3 /usr/local/oc/

Install Apache Tomcat 6.0.20
--------------------------------------------------------------
Next, download the binary files of Tomcat and extract the file. Create a user called tomcat. As root, put it in a system directory and set the $CATALINA_HOME environment variable to point to the install directory. The specific steps for doing this are listed below:

<as root>
/usr/sbin/adduser tomcat
/usr/sbin/groupadd developers
gpasswd -a tomcat developers
<as tomcat>
cd /home/tomcat
Download the Core Binary from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi 
tar -zxvf apache-tomcat-6.0.20.zip
<as root>
mv /home/tomcat/apache-tomcat-6.0.20 /usr/local/
cd /usr/local
ln -s apache-tomcat-6.0.20 tomcat
echo "export CATALINA_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat" >> /etc/profile

To install Tomcat as a standalone service (one that stops and starts with the system) you must install a daemon. 

<as root>
cp /usr/local/oc/OpenClinica-3.1-beta3/install-docs/linux/tomcatd /etc/init.d/
cd /etc/init.d
chmod 755 tomcatd
/sbin/chkconfig --del tomcatd
/sbin/chkconfig --add tomcatd
<exit and reboot your system>

You can manually stop and start tomcat with these scripts.
/usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
/usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

You can verify that tomcat is running by checking 
http://localhost:8080 

NOTE: If you are having difficulty getting the daemon to run at startup, assert that the line endings of the tomcatd file are the proper UNIX line terminators.

More detailed installation instructions for Apache Tomcat can be found at http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.5-doc/setup.html.

Install PostgreSQL 8.4.1
--------------------------------------------------------------
This installion assumes that the development libraries are properly installed, including gcc and make.For more information about installation please check the file called INSTALL after extracting the tar file. 

NOTE: Many Linux distributions come with postgres already installed. For those systems you can probably skip this section and go to "Create the OpenClinica Database". You will need to modify those commands to fit your postgres installation.

Go to http://svn.akazaresearch.com/oc/software/OpenClinica-3.1-beta3/linux

<as user>
cd TO SAVE LOCATION OF DOWNLOADED FILE
tar -zxvf postgresql-8.4.1.zip
cd postgresql-8.4.1
./configure
make
<as root>
make install
/usr/sbin/adduser postgres (if you have installed an older version of postgres the user might already exist)
gpasswd -a postgres developers
mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
echo "export PGDATA=/usr/local/pgsql/data" >> /etc/profile

Now setup postgres to run as a daemon

<as root>
cd /etc/init.d
cp /usr/local/oc/OpenClinica-3.1-beta3/install-docs/linux/postgresqld /etc/init.d/postgresql
Type "y" to confirm the overwrite of postgresql
chmod 755 postgresql
/sbin/chkconfig --levels 2345 postgresql on
<exit and reboot your system>
Check if postmaster is running, you should see several postgres processes
<as root>
ps -A | grep postmaster

NOTE: If you are having difficulty getting the daemon to run at startup, assert that the line endings of the postgresqld file are the proper UNIX line terminators.
More detailed installation instructions for Postgres can be found at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/index.html.

Create the Clinica User and openclinica Database
--------------------------------------------------------------
<as postgres>
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -f /usr/local/oc/OpenClinica-3.1-beta3/config/database/PostgreSQL/3.1-beta3/install/create_User_and_db_3.1-beta3.sql

NOTE: This step will fail if the clinica user has already been created. In this case you can skip this step.


Create Directory Structure
--------------------------------------------------------------
<as tomcat>
mkdir /usr/local/tomcat/openclinica.data/

NOTE: Make sure the tomcat user has read and write permissions on this directory. 

This path is required for saving uploaded CRFs and archived dataset files. 
Also, it is the home for the CRF spreadsheet template.

Once the application is deployed and operational, the system will create additional files and directories within this one. The final CRF and dataset file structure will be like the following:
	+---filePath
	+---crf                                 -  crf  blank template (CRF_Design_Template.xls )
	      +---new                           -  crf verion templates reorganized by system (.xls)
	      +---original                      - crf original templates uploaded from user's local machine (.xls)
	+---datasets
	    +---21                              - dataset files (.txt, .dat, .sps)
	    +---22                              - dataset files (.txt, .dat, .sps)
	    +---25                              - dataset files (.txt, .dat, .sps)
	    +---etc.                            - dataset files (.txt, .dat, .sps)
	+---rules
	    +---original                        - rules original xml files.

The folders 'new', 'original', 'rules' and 'datasets' will be created by OpenClinica application if they don't exist on the server. 

NOTE: Make sure the tomcat user has write permissions on all of these directories.

***OpenClinica Configuration Files - datainfo.properties
--------------------------------------------------------------
The next step is to copy the configuration files and the web application file (war) to the tomcat folders. Since tomcat is running, it will "hot-deploy" the application, creating the rest of the web application file structure.

<as tomcat>
cp /usr/local/oc/OpenClinica-3.1-beta3/distribution/OpenClinica.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps 
NOTE: If you do not see the expanded file structure after a minute (/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/OpenClinica), you can manually deploy the war file using the Tomcat Manager (http://localhost:8080/manager/html) 

There is one configuration file that needs to be changed.

Edit /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/OpenClinica/WEB-INF/classes/datainfo.properties and change the properties to suit your server environment as needed.  The initial datainfo.properties file looks something like this:

#############################################################################
# 1 - Database Configuration
#
# Database configuration is done with the following 6 properties
# The dbType options are either postgres or oracle.
# Enter the user name and password to access the database in 
# dbUser and dbPass.
# The db field is for the name of the database and provide the port
# in dbPort.
# dbHost can be a URL, IP address or localhost
#
# REQUIRED
#############################################################################
dbType=postgres
dbUser=clinica
dbPass=clinica
db=openclinica
dbPort=5432
dbHost=localhost

Please read the instructions in the file itself for the other configuration options.

Restart Tomcat
-------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: You will need to restart tomcat for these changes to take effect.
NOTE: RESTARTING TOMCAT IS VERY IMPORTANT (to restart tomcat, try the following commands:
<as root>
/etc/init.d/tomcatd restart

NOTE: /etc/init.d/tomcatd performs an su to tomcat to run the following commands:

/usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
/usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

These commands should never be run directly by root, only by tomcat.

At this point it is a good idea to check the web application to see if it deployed properly, and can make a database connection. Open a web browser on the system and go to http://<hostname>:8080/OpenClinica, you should see the OpenClinica login page. Login with the username "root" and the password "12345678". If you are unable to login, you either could not make a connection to the database, or the database is missing information. The Tomcat logs in /usr/local/tomcat/logs are a good source for additional information.


Configure HTTPS
--------------------------------------------------------------
Akaza Research strongly recommends securing the Tomcat application server using SSL. SSL is the technology used to make secured 'https://' connections. SSL requires a third-party security certificate to be effective. For more information, please contact@akazaresearch.com regarding our Enterprise services.


Verify System Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------
The following set of tasks must be conducted to ensure the system is setup correctly.

1. First make sure Tomcat is running and properly configured in Linux:
	Open a web browser on the system and go to http://<hostname>:8080/, you should see the Tomcat home page.
	<as tomcat>
	env | grep CATALINA_HOME
	<this should return /usr/local/tomcat>

2. Make sure Postgres is running:
	<as postgres>
	ps aux | grep postmaster
	<this should show one or more postmaster processes>

3. Verify Tomcat deployed the web application.
	Check $CATALINA_HOME/webapps for an OpenClinica directory.
	
4. Test in browser.
	On the server, if browser is installed, go to http://<hostname>:8080/OpenClinica
	Next, go to https://<hostname>/OpenClinica from a browser on a different machine.

5. Login.
	Login with the username "root" and the password "12345678". Please change this password as soon as you log in. The root user will be assigned a default project called "default". Create a technical admininstrator login for youself and secure the password for the default root user. Create user accounts, you will want to create at least one Study Coordinator.

	Refer users to the OpenClinica Quick Start for insructions on using the application.
